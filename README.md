# Escape Room Game: Propositional Logic-Based Project

## Overview
The **Escape Room Game** is an interactive and educational game designed to challenge players' logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Built using **Python and Tkinter**, this game presents a series of rooms filled with **puzzles, traps, and keys** that players must navigate to escape. By leveraging **propositional logic**, the game ensures that all puzzles are logically consistent and solvable, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

This project was developed as a **collaborative effort** by a team of **two developers**, showcasing teamwork, software development skills, and logical reasoning in game design.

## Key Features
- **Logical Puzzles**: Solve a variety of puzzles that require the application of **propositional logic** and logical reasoning.
- **Automated Puzzle Generation**: Puzzles are automatically generated and validated using **Prover9**, ensuring they are both challenging and solvable.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate through rooms, solve riddles, disarm traps, and collect keys to progress.
- **Educational Value**: Enhance understanding of **propositional logic** through a gamified experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Tkinter**, providing an intuitive graphical interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Graphical User Interface**: Tkinter
- **Theorem Prover**: Prover9 (for logic validation)

## Installation & Setup
To run the Escape Room Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CalinaBorzan/AI_PropositionalLogic_Project.git
cd AI_PropositionalLogic_Project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install tkinter
```

### 3. Run the Game:

```

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game and navigate through the **welcome screen** to begin your escape room adventure.
2. **Explore Rooms**: Use the interface to look around, solve puzzles, and collect keys.
3. **Solve Puzzles**: Apply logical reasoning to **solve riddles and disarm traps**.
4. **Escape**: Collect all necessary keys and navigate through the rooms to escape before time runs out.

## User Interface
The game features a **user-friendly interface** with the following key components:
- **Welcome Screen**: Start the game, view rules, or exit.
- **Game Menu**: Navigate to start the escape room or return to the welcome screen.
- **Escape Room Screen**: The main gameplay area where players interact with the environment.
- **Trap Dialog**: A dialog window that appears when a trap is triggered, presenting a riddle with a timer.

## Future Enhancements
The game has potential for further development, including:
- **More Interconnected Rooms**: Expanding the game world for increased complexity and engagement.
- **Expanded Puzzle Complexity**: Introducing **multi-step puzzles** that require deeper logical reasoning.
- **AI-Based Opponent**: Incorporating an AI opponent to compete with the player.
- **Multi-Player Support**: Developing a **multi-player mode** for collaborative or competitive gameplay.
- **Improved GUI**: Adding **animations and sound effects** for a more immersive experience.
- **Extended Logical Framework**: Implementing more **complex logical conditions and relations**.

## Conclusion
